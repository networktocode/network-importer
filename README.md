# Network Importer
The network importer is a tool to import/synchronize an existing network with a Network Source of Truth, it's designed to be idempotent and by default it's only showing the difference between the running network and the remote database. 

The main use cases for the network importer 
 - Import an existing network into a SOT (Netbox) as a first step to automate a brownfield network
 - Check the differences between the running network and the Source of Truth

## How to use 

The network importer can run either in `check` mode or in `apply` mode. 
 - In `check` mode, no modification will be made to the SOT, the differences will be printed on the screen
 - in `apply` mode, the SOT will be updated will all interfaces, IPs, vlans etc

## Start Batfish in a container

The network-importer requires to have access to a working batfish environment, you can easily start one using docker
```
docker run -d -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 batfish/batfish:2020.01.11.363
```

## Check/Create your devices in Netbox

A bare device needs to be already present in Netbox and the network-importer will be able to import all vlans, interfaces, ip addresses, cables, transceivers etc ..  
Currently, the network-importer is not creating the devices in Netbox.   

To be able to connect to the device the following information needs to be defined in NetBox:
- Primary ip address
- Platform (must be a valid napalm driver or have a valid napalm driver defined)
> Connecting to the device is not mandatory but some features depends on it: configuration update, transceivers, mostly cabling.

## Configuration file

```toml
[main]
# import_ips = true 
# import_prefixes = false
# import_cabling = "lldp"       # Valid options are ["lldp", "cdp", "config", false]

# import_vlans="config"         # Valid options are ["cli", "config", true, false]

# nbr_workers= 25

# Not fully fonctional right now, need to revisit that part
# generate_hostvars = false

# The information to connect to netbox needs to be provided, either in the config file or as environment variables

# Define a list of supported platform, 
# if defined all devices without platform or with a different platforms will be removed from the inventory
# supported_platforms = [ "ios", "nxos" ]

# Update device configuration on Netbox add the end of the execution
# status_update = false 
# status_on_pass = 1
# status_on_fail = 4
# status_on_unreachable = 0

# either in the configuration file or as environment variables ( & NETWORK_DEVICE_PWD)

[logs]
# Define log level, curently the logs are printed on the screen
# level = "info" # "debug", "info", "warning"

# For each run, a performance log is generated by default to capture how long
# some functions took to execute
# performance_log = true
# performance_log_directory = "performance_logs"
            
# When running in Apply mode, all the changes are logged in a changelog file
# the supported format are text and jsonlines
# change_log = true
# change_log_format= "text"  # "jsonlines", "text"
# change_log_filename= "changelog"
```

## Execution
Though exectuion can be performed directly from your shell via the `network-importer` command. It is recommended to use the Makefile helper.
There are multiple benfits of using this helper, such as:
* Any environment variables container within `.env`, such as network credentials will be exported into your environment.
* Your execution will be completey isolated.
* Batfish will be automatically restarted once your execution is complete. This will ensure the Batfish soft-cache memory allocation is released.

```
sudo make import NI_OPTS="--config ./dev.toml  --diff --check --update-configs"
```

Note: Before executing ensure you have your network device credentials have been added to `.env`. Please use `.env-example` for reference.


## How does it work

The network importer is using different tools to collect information from the network devices: 
- [batfish](https://github.com/batfish/batfish) to parse the configurations and extract a vendor neutral data model. 
- [nornir], [naplam], [netmiko] and [ntc-templates] to extract some information from the device cli if available





## Disclaimer / Assumption

Currently the library only supports netbox but the idea for 1.0 is to support multiple backend SOT
Currently the assumption is that vlans are global to a site. need to find a way to provide more flexibility here without making it too complex
